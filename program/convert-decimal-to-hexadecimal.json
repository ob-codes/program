Divide the decimal number by 16.\r\n2. Write down the remainder.\r\n3. Divide the quotient by 16.\r\n4. Write down the remainder.\r\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the quotient is 0.\r\n6. The hexadecimal number is the sequence of remainders written in reverse order.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInput  : 10\r\nOutput : A\r\n```\n\n---\n\n<CodeBlock>\n\n```java\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```js\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```kt\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```ts\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```py\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```php\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n</CodeBlock>\n\n","latestUpdateDate":"2022-12-05T05:04:06Z"}
