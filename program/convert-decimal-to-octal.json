Divide the decimal number by 8.\r\n2. Write down the remainder.\r\n3. Divide the quotient by 8.\r\n4. Write down the remainder.\r\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the quotient is 0.\r\n6. The octal number is the sequence of remainders written in reverse order.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInput  : 10\r\nOutput : 12\r\n```\n\n---\n\n<CodeBlock>\n\n```c\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```cpp\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```java\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```js\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```ts\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```py\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```go\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n</CodeBlock>\n\n","latestUpdateDate":"2022-12-02T06:03:31Z"}
