It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The digits are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0 or 1, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.\r\n\r\nTo convert a binary number to decimal, we can use the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. Multiply the first bit by 2^0.\r\n2. Multiply the second bit by 2^1.\r\n3. Multiply the third bit by 2^2.\r\n4. Multiply the fourth bit by 2^3.\r\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the last bit.\r\n6. Add the results of all the multiplications.\r\n7. The decimal number is the sum of all the multiplications.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInput  : 1010\r\nOutput : 10\r\n```\n\n---\n\n<CodeBlock>\n\n```c\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```cpp\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```cs\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```java\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```js\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```kt\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```swift\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```ts\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```py\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```dart\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```php\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n</CodeBlock>\n\n","latestUpdateDate":"2022-12-02T06:03:31Z"}
