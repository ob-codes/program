It uses only eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The digits are called octits. An octit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. An octit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.\n\nTo convert an octal number to decimal, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Multiply the first octit by 8^0.\n2. Multiply the second octit by 8^1.\n3. Multiply the third octit by 8^2.\n4. Multiply the fourth octit by 8^3.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the last octit.\n6. Add the results of all the multiplications.\n7. The decimal number is the sum of all the multiplications.\n\n```\nInput  : 12\nOutput : 10\n```\n\n---\n\n<CodeBlock>\n\n```c\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```cpp\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```java\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```js\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```ts\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```py\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n</CodeBlock>\n\n","latestUpdateDate":"2022-12-02T06:03:31Z"}
