It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The digits are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a computer. A bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit can be used to represent a single value, such as 0 or 1, or it can be used to represent a single state, such as on or off.\r\n\r\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. Divide the decimal number by 2.\r\n2. Write down the remainder.\r\n3. Divide the quotient by 2.\r\n4. Write down the remainder.\r\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the quotient is 0.\r\n6. The binary number is the sequence of remainders written in reverse order.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInput  : 10\r\nOutput : 1010\r\n```\n\n---\n\n<CodeBlock>\n\n```c\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```cpp\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```js\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```kt\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```py\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n```php\n404: Not Found\n```\n\n</CodeBlock>\n\n","latestUpdateDate":"2022-12-04T19:11:30Z"}
